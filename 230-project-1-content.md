# No-Fly Zone

## High Concept
The game I have chosen to make, will be a side-scrolling schmup, that takes elements from other schmup games, like
the Raiden schmup games, where the player will fight hordes of enemies and bosses, all the while dodging enemy
in a mini bullet-hell-esque fashion, accruing score based upon the time taken for completion and upon the amount of
enemies killed.

## Genre
As mentioned above the game will be a schmup, where the player flies from left to right across the screen, with elements of
a bullet hell ingrained, in order to challenge the player.

## Platform
The game will be on desktop only.

## Story
The story of the game is that your a fighter pilot fighting for a military faction that wishes to gain control of the
planet you are fighting on, by defeating the enemy and their generals. The overall theme of the game is perserverance
in the face of overwhelming odds. The mood of the game is one of adrenaline, concentration, and stress, as one to a few handul of
hits is enough to spell the player's demise. The overall narrative is that the player flies through hordes of enemies, unitl they
reach the boss(es) and defeat them. The premise of the game is that the player not only desires victory over the enemy, but also
recognition from their side, by trying toget higher scores. The player wil be motivated by the desire to challenge themselves, and
achieve a higher score each time as they shoot down enemy fighters and bosses.

## Esthetics
The graphics style will be 8 bit with a looping background, and with the sound being sci-fi-"ish" and looped. 
The types of sound the game has won't really change upon location, as the game doesn't really change location itself.
Their will be no real scoring sound, unless the explosion of enemy ships can be considered one, and the user interface will
generally mute all sound anyway. There isn't really a background sound at all. There will be sounds of enemy ships exploding and 
firing their weapons, with different sounds for the player's ship exploding and weapon fire, and the same goes for the bosses.

## Gameplay
The player can move up to the edges of the sceen as the camera moves, but can never really move out of sight of the camera.
The player can navigate their ship in all directions on the screen, but the ship will always be traveling right, and they can fire
their primary weapon with the press of a single button. The control scheme will revolve around using the keyboard.
As for how the player learns to play the game, there will be a window they can open, both before and during the game, to
view the controls. In order to learn to beat the game the player will have to learn enemy patterns, the spacing of their attacks.
